I regularly use this microwave, and it operates in a convenient and consistent way in most regards.
However, when the timer or cooking time ends and it beeps, it does not stop after a set number of beeps: it continues beeping indefinitely.
This does have some uses, such as if the user leaves before the timer ends, and might not notice beeping that stops after a few moments.
The sustained beeping however quickly becomes extremely irritating for people with sensitivities to sound, requiring them to mute the sound if they are going to make regular use of it.
Settings adjustment is done by pressing the Clock/Settings button until the setting you want to adjust is shown, and then pressing Start/Add 30.
There is an inconsistency in how the settings are adjusted: Most of them are simple on/off settings, ressing Start/Add 30 switches between on and off.
The settings that have more than two options, such as sound (high, low, off), work differently:
    upon reaching one, the different options cycle through one at a time, where one can be selected by pressing Start/Add 30 while it is being shown.
This is unintuitive and not explained by the text on the screen, which includes a dedicated piece of lit up text saying "Press Start".
